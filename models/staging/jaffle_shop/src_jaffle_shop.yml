      # if the source has a timestamp for when each row is loaded into the database
      # you can add a freshness warning and/or error to make sure the sources are updating as expected.
      # it will compare the current_timestamp at run time to the max(_etl_loaded_at) timestamp
      # for market data, how does this handle weekends?  can you make cases or something?
